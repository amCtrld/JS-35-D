# Project-Based Learning Roadmap

## 1. Variables and Data Types:
### Number Guessing Game:

- Use variables to store the secret number, user's guess, and number of attempts.

### Basic Calculator:

- Demonstrate different data types (numbers, strings) for input and output.

### User Information:

- Create a simple program that collects user information and displays it.

## 2. Operators:
### Temperature Converter:

- Implement conversion formulas using arithmetic operators.

### Simple Interest Calculator:

- Utilize arithmetic operators for calculations.

## 3. Control Flow:
### Grade Calculator:

- Employ conditional statements to determine grades based onmarks.

### Even or Odd Checker:

- Use conditional statements to classify numbers.

## 4. Functions:
### Area and Perimeter Calculator:

- Create functions to calculate area and perimeter of different shapes.

### Factorial Calculator:

- Implement a recursive or iterative function to find factorials.

### Greetings:

- Create a program that greets the user based on the time of day.

## 5. Objects:
### Student Record:

- Create objects to store student information (name, roll number, marks).

### Product Catalog:

- Represent products as objects with properties like name, price, description.

## 6. Arrays:
### To-do List:

- Use arrays to store tasks and manipulate them (add, remove, complete).

### Number Sorting:

- Implement sorting algorithms (bubble sort, selection sort) using arrays.

## 7. Selecting Elements:
### Basic HTML Structure:

- Create a simple HTML structure and practice selecting elements using DOM methods.

### Element Highlighter:

- Highlight elements on click or hover using selectors.

## 8. Modifying Elements:
### Dynamic Content:

- Modify element content based on user input or other events.

### Styling Elements:

- Change element styles (color, size, position) dynamically.

### User Profile:

- Create a program that updates a user profile.

## 9. Event Handling:
### Click Counter:

- Increment a counter on button clicks.

### Form Validation:

- Validate user input in forms using event listeners.

### Gallery:

- Create an interactive photo gallery.

## 10. Asynchronous JS:
### Data Fetching:

- Fetch data from an API and display it on the page.

### Timer:

- Create a countdown timer using asynchronous functions.

## 11. Error Handling:
### Division Calculator:

- Implement error handling for division by zero.

### Form Validation with Error Messages:

- Display error messages for invalid form inputs.

## 12. Modules:
### Modular Calculator:

- Create modules for different calculator operations (addition, subtraction, etc.).

### Reusable Components:

- Build reusable components for your projects.

### Modular To-do:

- Create a modularized version of the to-do list application.

## 13. OOP:
### Bank Account:

- Create a bank account class with properties and methods (deposit,
  withdraw, check balance).

### Shape Calculator:

- Create classes for different shapes (circle, rectangle, triangle) with area and perimeter methods.

### Student Management:

- Create a class-based version of the student management application.

## 14. Functional Programming:
### Higher-Order Functions:

- Experiment with functions as arguments and return values.

### Pure Functions:

- Create functions with no side effects.

### Functional Calculator:

- Create a functional version of the calculator application.
